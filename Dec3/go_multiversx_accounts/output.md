To request tokens, visit the appropriate MultiversX faucet:
1. For each account, copy the Bech32-formatted address.
2. Visit the testnet/devnet faucet page: https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/web-wallet/#testnet-and-devnet-faucet
3. Enter the account address and request test tokens.
4. Gather your transaction hashes for verification.





Now lets start afresh. You tak is to generate a complete script for implementation on ubuntu machine with detailed comments nad steps to execution. Create a script that generates three accounts in each shard and requests tokens from the faucet for them for a Multiversx blockchain. PL: - the script must be implemented in rust. Account Generation: - the script must generate exactly 3 unique accounts per shard (total accounts:9- 3 in shard0, 3 in shard1, 3 in shard2) Token Request: - https://docs.multiversx.com/wallet/web-wallet/#testnet-and-devnet-faucet Verification: - Based on your decision to use testnet or devnet, you will have to also provide the proof of the results by adding the transaction hash in documentation or in the submission form. Usability: - the script should be executed in a single command - the fauceting can be done via manual intervention via web-wallet - extra points for those automating the process. Documentation: - provide clear instruction on how to execute the script.
